# MCET-HHO

We provided the [Minimum Cross Entropy Thresholding - Harris Hawks Optimization (MCET-HHO)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417420302529) for multilevel thresholding segmentation. This method has been tested on an image reference set of the literature, the Berkeley segmentation database, and digital mammography medical images.
